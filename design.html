        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p>Outlined below is the design process that was conducted in order to acheive our final prototype for Aria. 
            The theme of this group project was "Home of the Future". Our problem space was specific to safety in dating. As our group was 3 female college students, we felt this space was relatable 
            and something we had a passion for improving. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h3>Problem Space</h3>
        <p>
            This space was specific to the safety precautions taken when inviting strangers into the home. 
            This can include online dates in your home or someone new, or even having workers there for routine maintence. 
            Especially with the new restrictions of the pandemic, the options are limited for where you can meet new people. 
            Meeting people online you donâ€™t know their intentions, history or even if they are who they say they are. Safety has 
            always been a concern for vulnerable populations and we wanted to design to ease the nerves of these populations and provide
            and added layer of safety.
        </p>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>Stakeholders</h3>
        <p>
            Our stakeholders include anyone involved in the online dating process, young people living alone and anyone in a 
            minority population that may feel vulnerable with others in their home.
        </p>
    </div>

        <h3>Contextual Inquiry</h3>
        <p>
            We talked to 4 female college students in order to get a sense of their experiences in the online dating scene.
            We saw that all of our participants had notified their friends before and has some sort of code in place 
            if there was a need for their assistance. Our main takeaway from this contect study was that discretion was key when they
            felt uncomfortable in a situation. They explained that they felt confronting their date would only escalte the situation and wouldn't
            feel safe to do so. 
        </p>

        <h3>Our Intervention</h3>
        <p>
            Our plan of attack was to design a mobile app that would connect to any voice recognition software such as Siri, Google Home, etc.
            This app could be preset by the user with key phrases and gestures that would trigger a response. Such responses could be anything 
            from sending a preset message to your emergency contacts to calling 911 and sedning your location. The triggers and action are 
            completely customizable for the best user experience.

        <h3>User Evaluations</h3>
        <p>
            After creating our first prototype we conducted user evaluations. Five observational interviews where conducted to determine
            easy of usability. The primary goal her was to gauge how intuitive our user interface was. Second, we conducted 5 context interviews.
            These were used to determine is our methodology was more effective than our participants previous methods. Here, we walked our participants
            through a scenario of being on a date that progressively escalates and we asked them how the would approach each event. Then we explained our app 
            and asked them to go through the scenarios again and whether or not they would do anything different. Our main takeaways from this process were
            the participants appreciated the ability to contact their friends with a simple phrase or gesture instead of having to sneakily text their friends
            when their date was around.
